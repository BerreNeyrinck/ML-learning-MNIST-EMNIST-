upload of a school project where I am tasked with creating a simple ML-agent that can correctly discern numbers and letters from the MNIST and EMNISTdatasets 

The first file, "Labo4_1_MNIST.py" uses a standard MNIST dataset imported using KERAS parcing it through a 3layer model to give its prediction.

The second, "Labo4_2_EMNIST.py" makes use of the tenserflow_datasets library to import the EMNIST dataset. Most of this code is made using the online quickstart at: "https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/keras_example"
